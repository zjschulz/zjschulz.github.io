Know your level of skill. A lesson learned through frustration. This is my first time writing a blog post and my first time trying to code on my own. As I am going through the Flat Iron School through their Online Software Engineering cohort, I am to create a command line interface(CLI) as my final project for the first module of the course. Through my first Flat Iron project experience I learned two things, time management and knowing your limits.

At the onset of my project, I was determined to create a CLI based on the Dungeons and Dragons list of spells. My plan was to scrape from one of the many websites documenting all of the spells and creating a search engine from this data. Unbeknownst to me, this would prove to be a difficult task. I would either: A. Try to scrape from a website that I was not authorized to use, getting an HTTP 400 status error, B. Try to scrape from a table or site that used it's own serach engine built into the page, or C. Try to scrape from a table that used advanced java techniques used to hide or stack the information. All three of these obstacles proved too difficult for me, at my level, to work around to get the information I needed.

The above proved frustrating and time consuming. Not only did it do a number on my self-confidence, but it took up a chunk of time that needed to be allotted for my project. Unlike some other members in my cohort or any other cohort in Flat Iron, I work a full time job and have a child. My coding time is precious and cannot be wasted. This project tested that to the extreme. Hence why my decision to back out of my original idea may have been my best decision thus far of my coding career.

Here's why.

After that decision, my outlook on the project as a whole changed. I spent more time actually coding and being able to lookup the exact techniques and methods I needed on Google, Slack, etc., and less time struggling on one singular aspect of my project. I was able to learn the techniques needed to take the scraped data and convert it into objects to use in the CLI portion. 

If I could go back in time and restart my project, I would focus more on what I was able to do at the time instead of focring what I wanted to do. There will be a time when I can be more abitious, however for someone starting up coding for the first time with no background in it, that time is not now. To reiterate my initial thoughts, going into a project like this I absolutely need to know how to manage my time and I definitely need to know my limits.
