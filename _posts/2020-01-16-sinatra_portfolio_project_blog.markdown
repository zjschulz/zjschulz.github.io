The Sinatra Portfolio Project was significantly easier than the initial CLI Portfolio Project. This is due to many factors, the most relevant being a few super useful YouTube videos, the way the material was presented to us, and a heightened sense of confidence at this point in time in the curriculum. 

Ally Kadel created the most useful YouTube videos for the Sinatra Portfolio project. Yes, they were essentially a step by step how to document on how to do the project, however it was much more. By spending the multitude of hours watching the videos and coding along, I was able to properly understand how the application was built and also how to apply the concepts learned throughout our lessons and labs. For instance, the way she walked through creating the CRUD actions, it allowed you to see how the relationships were built as well as how forms and routes related to the various views used. 

In this module, the labs and written material built off each other quite nicely. As we progressed through the curriculum, it became evident that each skill taught would be used in the up coming course material. Therefore, it was crucial to devote enough time to each portion in order to succeed. However, the Sinatra portion of the curriculum double downed on this. It seemed as though each lab forced you to start from scratch or from an early starting point in the creation of each lab. By the end of the Sinatra portion, my knowledge of rake migrations, module relationships, and CRUD actions was already keen.

And confidence. Being able to see a web page come to life is a beautiful thing. Even more beautiful is being able to proudly say that you built that. The first project we did the same, but command lines applications aren't flashy, nor are they used widely anymore for the public use. But, in this case, most everyone in the modern world with computer access has used the internet at least once. We were able to build apps that help categorize and store info that was important to us. We even build functionality so multiple users can do the same to share interests. With this project, the future that Flatiron has been building for us is starting to become clear.Â 

Thank you Flatiron.
